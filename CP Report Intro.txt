Title: Greek Restaurant in New York City (report)

1. Introduction
   We are going to present a guide on how to choose the best location in New York City to open a Greek Restaurant. Our targeted 
audience is obviously people who want to invest money on a restaurant business in New York City and have a passion with Greek food 
(maybe Greek Americans!).
   The choice will take into account the number of Greek restaurants (positive indicator) and the number of general type restaurants 
(negative indicator) in each New York City neighborhood. For example if there exists a neighborhood where one out of ten restaurants 
are Greek then people in this area seem to be very intrested in Greek food and its a good place to open a business (that is the basic 
idea but keep in mind that we need to consider some observations which do not act well in our model). 
   In the first section we will introduce our data and take it in the desired form, so we can easily work with it later. In the second 
section we will analyse the data and visualize it (maps). After that we will built our model (the one which will predict how suitable 
a neighborhood is to open a Greek restaurant business) using machine learning techniques and finally we will visualize the clusters.
   More on the second part of the assignment...
