Title: Greek Restaurant in New York City (report)

2. Data Section
   The data needed for this project is New York neighborhoods data which can be found in this link: 
https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572  , and Foursquare data for the venues (restaurants) which we will get, using requests 
with Foursquare API. 
   Both data sets are crucial even for the definition of our problem. The neighborhoods data will be used mainly for visualization 
(New York maps) and the Foursquare venue data for training the model and cluster the neighborhoods based on the suitability of opening 
a Greek restaurant.
